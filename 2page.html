    <h1 style="font-size: 15px; color:white;">Hello Everyone I'm Jey Calixtro 19 Years Old, and it's my pleasure to introduce myself. im from city of san jose del monte bulacan. I studied in First city providential College and am now taking a program of Bachelor of Science Information Technology. My strength is that I am always ready to take up new challenges and strive for excellence. This is because I believe success and failures are the best way to sculpt ourselves to reach our goals. And I believe in myself and my hard work and want fulfillment in everything. My short-term goal is to achieve excellence in the skills i'm taking this program, take up a challenge in some good organizations, and climb the ladder of success. However, my long-term goal is to be a software developer in an organization and reach the highest level of success. My moral is never to intend to harm anyone on purpose.
